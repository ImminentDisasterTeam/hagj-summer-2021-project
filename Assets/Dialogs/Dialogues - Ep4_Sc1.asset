      die." '

    Text: Then glorious Shamash answered the hero Enlil, "It was by your command
      they killed the Bull of Heaven, and killed Humbaba, and must Enkidu die although
      innocent?" Enlil flung round in rage at glorious Shamash, "You dare to say
      this, you who went about with them every day like one of themselves!"

    Text: O my brother, so dear as you are to me, brother, yet they will take me

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Who is there in strong-walled Uruk who has wisdom like this? Strange things
      have been spoken, why does your heart speak strangely? The dream was marvellous
      but the terror was great. We must treasure the dream whatever the terror. For
      the dream has shown that misery comes at last to the healthy man, the end of
      life is sorrow. Now I will pray to the great gods, for my friend had an ominous
      dream.

  - CharacterName: Enkidu
    Text: My friend, the great goddess cursed me and I must die in shame. I shall
      not die like a man fallen in battle. I scared to fall, but happy is the man
      who falls in the battle, for I must die in shame.
