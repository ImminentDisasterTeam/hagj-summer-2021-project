  - CharacterName: Men of Uruk
    Text: Gilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement, his arrogance has no bounds

      even the children.

  - CharacterName: Men of Uruk
    Text: Yet the king should be a shepherd to his people. His lust leaves no virgin
      to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble. Yet
      this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.

  - CharacterName: Narrator
    Text: The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven asked Aruru, the goddess
      of creation, to create Gilgamesh's equal, so that he would be as like him as
      his own reflection, his second self. So the goddess conceived an image in her
      mind, and it was of the stuff of Anu of the firmament. She dipped her hands
      in water and pinched off clay, she let it fall in the wilderness, and noble
      Enkidu was created.
