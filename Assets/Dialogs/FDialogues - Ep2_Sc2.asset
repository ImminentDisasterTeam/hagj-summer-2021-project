    Text: Gilgamesh and Enkidu had many adventures together. They had a trip to the
      cedar forest, where the Humbaba, a ferocious giant, lived. He was appointed
      to guard cedars and armed with sevenfold terrors. When he roared it was like
      the torrent of the storm, his breath was like fire, and his jaws were death
      itself. But Gilgamesh and Enkidu were strong and courageous and were able to
      defeat Humbaba.
