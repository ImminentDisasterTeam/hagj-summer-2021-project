    Text: You are wise, Enkidu, and now you have become like a god. Why do you want
      to run wild with the beasts in the hills? Come with me. I will take you to
      strong-walled Uruk, to the blessed temple of Ishtar and of Anu, of love and
      of heaven there Gilgamesh lives, who is very strong, and like a wild bull he
      lords it over men.

    Text: Let us go, and let him see your face. I know very well where Gilgamesh
      is in great Uruk. O Enkidu, you who love life, I will show you Gilgamesh, a
      man of many moods. You shall look at him well in his radiant manhood. His body
      is perfect in strength and maturity. He is stronger than you, so leave your
      boasting. I tell you, even before you have left the wilderness, Gilgamesh will
      know in his dreams that you are coming.
