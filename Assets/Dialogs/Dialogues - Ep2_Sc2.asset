  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Let's go to the country where the cedar is felled. I will set up my name
      in the place where the names of famous men are written, and where no man's
      name is written yet I will wise a monument to the gods. We will go to the forest
      and destroy the evil that is in the land. For in the forest lives Humbaba,
      a ferocious giant.

    Text: 'When I went with the wild beasts ranging through the wilderness I discovered
      the huge forest. Enlil has appointed Humbaba to guard it and armed him with

      is like fire, and his jaws are death itself. '

    Text: 'What man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths?
      I tell you, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it: it is not an equal struggle
      when one fights with Humbaba. He is a great warrior, a battering-ram.'

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Where is the man who can clamber to heaven? Only the gods live for ever
      with glorious Shamash, but as for us men, our days are numbered, our occupations
      are a breath of wind. How is this, already you are afraid! I will go first
      although I am your lord. Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures.
      Men will say of me, "Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba"!
