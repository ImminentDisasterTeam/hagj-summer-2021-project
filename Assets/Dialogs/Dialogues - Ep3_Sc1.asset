    Text: Gilgamesh washed out his long locks and cleaned his weapons. He flung back
      his hair from his shoulders. He threw off his stained clothes and changed them
      for new. He put on his royal robes and made them fast. When Gilgamesh had put
      on the crown, glorious Ishtar lifted her eyes and saw the beauty of Gilgamesh.

    Text: Come to me Gilgamesh, and be my bridegroom. I will harness for you a chariot
      of lapis lazuli and of gold, with wheels of gold and horns of copper. When
      you enter our house in the fragrance of cedar-wood, threshold and throne will
      kiss your feet. Kings, rulers, and princes will bow down before you. They shall
      bring you tribute from the mountains and the plain.

    Text: If I take you in marriage, what gifts can I give in return? What ointments
      and clothing for your body? I would gladly give you bread and all sorts of
      food fit for a god. I would give you wine to drink fit for a queen. I would
      pour out barley to stuff your granary. But as for making you my wife - that
      I will not.

    Text: Your lovers have found you like a brazier which smoulders in the cold,
      a backdoor which keeps out neither squall of wind nor storm, pitch that blackens
      the bearer, a stone which falls from the parapet, a battering-ram turned back
      from the enemy, a sandal that trips the wearer. Which of your lovers did you
      ever love for ever? What shepherd of yours has pleased you for all time?

    Text: 'You have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for
      him. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you decreed
      whip and spur and a thong, to gallop seven leagues by force. You have loved
      the shepherd of the flock. He made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed
      kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf, now his own herd-boys
      chase him away.'
