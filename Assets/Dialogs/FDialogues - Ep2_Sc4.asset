    Text: Hear me, great ones of Uruk, I weep for Enkidu, my friend, bitterly moaning
      like a woman mourning I weep for my brother. O Enkidu, my brother, you were
      the axe at my side, my hand's strength. An evil Fate has robbed me. All the
      wild things of the plain and pastures that nourished you weep for you. Let
      the great ones of strong-walled Uruk weep for you.

    Text: Enkidu, young brother. Hark, there is an echo through all the country like
      a mother mourning. The river along whose banks we used to walk, weeps for you.
      The mountain we climbed where we slew the Watchman, weeps for you. The warriors
      of strong-walled Uruk where the Bull of Heaven was killed, weep for you. What
      is this sleep which holds you now? You are lost in the dark and cannot hear
      me.

    Text: Gilgamesh touched Enkidu heart but it did not beat, nor did he lift his
      eyes again.  So Gilgamesh laid a veil, as one veils the bride, over his friend.
      The next day, in the first light, Gilgamesh lamented. Seven days and seven
      nights he wept for Enkidu, until the worm fastened on him. Only then he gave
      him up to the earth, for the Anunnaki, the judges, had seized him.

    Text: Then Gilgamesh issued a proclamation through the land, he summoned all
      and commanded them to make a statue of his friend. The statue was fashioned
      with a great weight of lapis lazuli for the breast and of gold for the body.
      Gilgamesh set out a table of hard-wood, and on it a bowl of carnelian filled
      with honey, and a bowl of lapis lazuli filled with butter. These he exposed 
      and offered to the Sun and weeping he went away.
