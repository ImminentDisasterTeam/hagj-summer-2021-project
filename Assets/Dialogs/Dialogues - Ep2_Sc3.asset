    Text: I know the place where Humbaba lives and the paths where he walks. But
      do not go down into the forest. When I opened the gate my hand lost its strength.

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Dear friend, do not speak like a coward. Have we got the better of so many
      dangers and travelled so far, to turn back at last? You, who are tried in wars
      and battles, hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death. Keep beside
      me and your weakness will pass, the trembling will leave your hand.

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Would my friend rather stay behind? No, we will, go down together into
      the heart of the forest. Let your courage be roused by the battle to come.
      Forget death and follow me. When two go together each will protect himself
      and shield his companion, and if they fall they leave an enduring name.

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: If your heart is fearful throw away fear. If there is terror in it throw
      away terror. Take your axe in your hand and attack. He who leaves the fight
      unfinished is not at peace.
