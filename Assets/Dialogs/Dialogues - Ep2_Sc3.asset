    Text: Dear friend, do not speak like a coward. Have we got the better of so many
      dangers and travelled so far, to turn back at last? You, who are tried in wars
      and battles, hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death. Keep beside
      me and your weakness will pass, the trembling will leave your hand.

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Would my friend rather stay behind? No, we will, go down together into
      the heart of the forest. Let your courage be roused by the battle to come.
      Forget death and follow me. When two go together each will protect himself
      and shield his companion, and if they fall they leave an enduring name.
