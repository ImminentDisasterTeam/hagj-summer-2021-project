  Phrases:
  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Mother, last night I had a dream. I was full of joy and I walked through
      the night under the stars of the firmament, and one, a meteor of the stuff
      of Anu, fell down from heaven. I tried to lift it but it proved too heavy.
      And to me its attraction was like the love of woman. People of Uruk helped
      me, I braced my forehead and I raised it with thongs and brought it to you,
      and you yourself pronounced it my brother.

  - CharacterName: Ninsun
    Text: This star of heaven which descended like a meteor from the sky is the strong
      comrade, the one who brings help to his friend in his need. He is the strongest
      of wild creatures, the stuff of Anu. He was born in the grass-lands and the
      wild hills reared him. When you see him you will be glad. You will love him
      as a woman and he will never forsake you. This is the meaning of the dream.

  - CharacterName: Trapper
    Text: A man unlike any other is roaming now in the pastures. He is as strong
      as a star from heaven and I am afraid to approach him. He helps the wild game
      to escape. He fills in my pits and pulls up my traps.

  - CharacterName: Gilgamesh
    Text: Trapper, go back, take with you a harlot Shamhat, a child of pleasure.
      At the drinking hole she will strip, and when, he sees her beckoning he will
      embrace her and the game of the wilderness will surely reject him.
