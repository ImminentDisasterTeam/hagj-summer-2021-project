Enkidu,I know the place where Humbaba lives and the paths where he walks. But do not go down into the forest. When I opened the gate my hand lost its strength.,Right,Gilgamesh,Enkidu
Gilgamesh,"Dear friend, do not speak like a coward. Have we got the better of so many dangers and travelled so far, to turn back at last? You, who are tried in wars and battles, hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death. Keep beside me and your weakness will pass, the trembling will leave your hand.",Left,Gilgamesh,Enkidu
Gilgamesh,"Would my friend rather stay behind? No, we will, go down together into the heart of the forest. Let your courage be roused by the battle to come. Forget death and follow me. When two go together each will protect himself and shield his companion, and if they fall they leave an enduring name.",Left,Gilgamesh,Enkidu
Gilgamesh,If your heart is fearful throw away fear. If there is terror in it throw away terror. Take your axe in your hand and attack. He who leaves the fight unfinished is not at peace.,Left,Gilgamesh,Enkidu
