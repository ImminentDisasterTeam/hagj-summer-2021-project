Narrator,"Gilgamesh washed out his long locks and cleaned his weapons. He flung back his hair from his shoulders. He threw off his stained clothes and changed them for new. He put on his royal robes and made them fast. When Gilgamesh had put on the crown, glorious Ishtar lifted her eyes and saw the beauty of Gilgamesh.",None,None,None
Ishtar,"Come to me Gilgamesh, and be my bridegroom. I will harness for you a chariot of lapis lazuli and of gold, with wheels of gold and horns of copper. When you enter our house in the fragrance of cedar-wood, threshold and throne will kiss your feet. Kings, rulers, and princes will bow down before you. They shall bring you tribute from the mountains and the plain.",Right,Gilgamesh,Ishtar
Gilgamesh,"If I take you in marriage, what gifts can I give in return? What ointments and clothing for your body? I would gladly give you bread and all sorts of food fit for a god. I would give you wine to drink fit for a queen. I would pour out barley to stuff your granary. But as for making you my wife - that I will not.",Left,Gilgamesh,Ishtar
Gilgamesh,"Your lovers have found you like a brazier which smoulders in the cold, a backdoor which keeps out neither squall of wind nor storm, pitch that blackens the bearer, a stone which falls from the parapet, a battering-ram turned back from the enemy, a sandal that trips the wearer. Which of your lovers did you ever love for ever? What shepherd of yours has pleased you for all time?",Left,Gilgamesh,Ishtar
Gilgamesh,"You have loved the lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug for him. You have loved the stallion magnificent in battle, and for him you decreed whip and spur and a thong, to gallop seven leagues by force. You have loved the shepherd of the flock. He made meal-cake for you day after day, he killed kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf, now his own herd-boys chase him away.",Left,Gilgamesh,Ishtar
Gilgamesh,"And if you and I should be lovers, should not I be served in the same fashion as all these others whom you loved once?",Left,Gilgamesh,Ishtar
Ishtar,"Gilgamesh has heaped insults on me, he has told over all my abominable behaviour, my foul and hideous acts.",Right,None,Ishtar
