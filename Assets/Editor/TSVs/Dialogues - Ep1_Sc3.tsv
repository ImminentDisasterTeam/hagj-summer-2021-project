Gilgamesh	Mother, last night I had a dream. I was full of joy and I walked through the night under the stars of the firmament, and one, a meteor of the stuff of Anu, fell down from heaven. I tried to lift it but it proved too heavy. And to me its attraction was like the love of woman. People of Uruk helped me, I braced my forehead and I raised it with thongs and brought it to you, and you yourself pronounced it my brother.	Left	Gilgamesh	None
Ninsun	This star of heaven which descended like a meteor from the sky is the strong comrade, the one who brings help to his friend in his need. He is the strongest of wild creatures, the stuff of Anu. He was born in the grass-lands and the wild hills reared him. When you see him you will be glad. You will love him as a woman and he will never forsake you. This is the meaning of the dream.	None	Gilgamesh	None
Trapper	Gilgamesh king in Uruk! Please help me!	None	Gilgamesh	None
Trapper	A man unlike any other is roaming now in the pastures. He is as strong as a star from heaven and I am afraid to approach him. He helps the wild game to escape. He fills in my pits and pulls up my traps.	None	Gilgamesh	None
Gilgamesh	Trapper, go back, take with you a harlot Shamhat, a child of pleasure. At the drinking hole she will strip, and when, he sees her beckoning he will embrace her and the game of the wilderness will surely reject him.	Left	Gilgamesh	None
Gilgamesh	A friend, a counsellor has come to me from Enlil the god of wind, and now I shall befriend and counsel him. I will wait for him to come to me in Uruk.	Left	Gilgamesh	None
