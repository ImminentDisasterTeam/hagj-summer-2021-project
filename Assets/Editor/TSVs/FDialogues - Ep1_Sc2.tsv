Men of Uruk	Gilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement, his arrogance has no bounds by day or night. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all, even the children.	None	None	None
Men of Uruk	Yet the king should be a shepherd to his people. His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble. Yet this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.	None	None	None
Narrator	The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven asked Aruru, the goddess of creation, to create Gilgamesh's equal, so that he would be as like him as his own reflection, his second self. So the goddess conceived an image in her mind, and it was of the stuff of Anu of the firmament. She dipped her hands in water and pinched off clay, she let it fall in the wilderness, and noble Enkidu was created.	None	None	None
