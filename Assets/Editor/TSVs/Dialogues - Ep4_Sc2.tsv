Narrator	This day on which Enkidu dreamed came to an end and be lay stricken with sickness. One whole day he lay on his bed and his suffering increased. A second day he lay on his bed and Gilgamesh watched over him but the sickness increased.	None	None	None
Narrator	A third day he lay on his bed, he called out to Gilgamesh, rousing him up. Now he was weak and his eyes were blind with weeping. Ten days he lay and his suffering increased, eleven and twelve days he lay on his bed of pain. And Gilgamesh wept over Enkidu.	None	None	None
Gilgamesh	Hear me, great ones of Uruk, I weep for Enkidu, my friend, bitterly moaning like a woman mourning I weep for my brother. O Enkidu, my brother, you were the axe at my side, my hand's strength. An evil Fate has robbed me. All the wild things of the plain and pastures that nourished you weep for you. Let the great ones of strong-walled Uruk weep for you.	Right	None	Gilgamesh
Gilgamesh	Enkidu, young brother. Hark, there is an echo through all the country like a mother mourning. The river along whose banks we used to walk, weeps for you. The mountain we climbed where we slew the Watchman, weeps for you. The warriors of strong-walled Uruk where the Bull of Heaven was killed, weep for you. What is this sleep which holds you now? You are lost in the dark and cannot hear me.	Right	None	Gilgamesh
Narrator	Gilgamesh touched Enkidu heart but it did not beat, nor did he lift his eyes again.  So Gilgamesh laid a veil, as one veils the bride, over his friend. The next day, in the first light, Gilgamesh lamented. Seven days and seven nights he wept for Enkidu, until the worm fastened on him. Only then he gave him up to the earth, for the Anunnaki, the judges, had seized him.	None	None	None
Narrator	Then Gilgamesh issued a proclamation through the land, he summoned all and commanded them to make a statue of his friend. The statue was fashioned with a great weight of lapis lazuli for the breast and of gold for the body. Gilgamesh set out a table of hard-wood, and on it a bowl of carnelian filled with honey, and a bowl of lapis lazuli filled with butter. These he exposed  and offered to the Sun and weeping he went away.	None	None	None
