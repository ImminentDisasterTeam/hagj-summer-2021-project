Gilgamesh	My friend, why do you sigh so bitterly?	Left	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Enkidu	I am weak, my arms have lost their strength, the cry of sorrow sticks in my throat, I am oppressed by idleness.	Right	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Gilgamesh	Let's go to the country where the cedar is felled. I will set up my name in the place where the names of famous men are written, and where no man's name is written yet I will wise a monument to the gods. We will go to the forest and destroy the evil that is in the land. For in the forest lives Humbaba, a ferocious giant.	Left	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Enkidu	When I went with the wild beasts ranging through the wilderness I discovered the huge forest. Enlil has appointed Humbaba to guard it and armed him with sevenfold terrors. When he roars it is like the torrent of the storm, his breath is like fire, and his jaws are death itself. 	Right	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Enkidu	What man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths? I tell you, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it: it is not an equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba. He is a great warrior, a battering-ram.	Right	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Gilgamesh	Where is the man who can clamber to heaven? Only the gods live for ever with glorious Shamash, but as for us men, our days are numbered, our occupations are a breath of wind. How is this, already you are afraid! I will go first although I am your lord. Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures. Men will say of me, "Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba"!	Left	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
Enkidu	O my lord, if you will enter that country, I will follow you!	Right	Gilgamesh	Enkidu
