Enkidu	O my brother, such a dream I had last night. Anu, Enlil and heavenly Shamash took counsel together, and Anu said to Enlil, "Because they have killed the Bull of Heaven, and because they have killed Humbaba  one of the two must, die." 	Left	Enkidu	Gilgamesh
Enkidu	Then glorious Shamash answered the hero Enlil, "It was by your command they killed the Bull of Heaven, and killed Humbaba, and must Enkidu die although innocent?"	Left	Enkidu	Gilgamesh
Enkidu	O my brother, so dear as you are to me, brother, yet they will take me from you. I must sit down on the threshold of the dead and never again will I see my dear brother with my eyes.	Left	Enkidu	Gilgamesh
Gilgamesh	Who is there in strong-walled Uruk who has wisdom like this? Strange things have been spoken, why does your heart speak strangely? The dream was marvellous but the terror was great. We must treasure the dream whatever the terror. For the dream has shown that misery comes at last to the healthy man, the end of life is sorrow. Now I will pray to the great gods, for my friend had an ominous dream.	Right	Enkidu	Gilgamesh
Enkidu	My friend, the great goddess cursed me and I must die in shame. I shall not die like a man fallen in battle. I scared to fall, but happy is the man who falls in the battle, for I must die in shame.	Left	Enkidu	Gilgamesh
